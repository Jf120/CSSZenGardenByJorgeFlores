# CSS Zen Garden Project
This project is a submission for my WDD331 R class and is based on the CSS Zen Garden concept. The CSS Zen Garden is a website that showcases the power of CSS by presenting different visual designs using the same HTML markup.

Description
The CSS Zen Garden project aims to demonstrate the versatility and creativity of CSS in transforming the appearance of a website without modifying the underlying HTML structure. By applying different CSS styles, we can create unique visual designs while keeping the content intact.
I decided to go for a minimalist look with some retro neon colors.
